        <p id="reason">She has been dreaming about opening a cookie shop in her lifetime. 
            She practices how to bake and create those great recipes that you see today. 
            She mastered different techniques of baking when she is young. Then she decided 
            to open a cookie shop because cookies are one of the first recipes that she baked 
            when she was young, it also reminds her of her mother who used to teach her everything 
            that she needs to know. So she decided to spread those memories and love to other people. </p>

        <h1>Let’s get to know us more</h1><br>
        <article>
        <p>Our mission and vision are to spread joy and kindness around the world. We know everyone is getting through some hard
        times especially due to this COVID-19. So we decided to open an online shop to help those raise some money to
        donate it to an orphanage. That is some of the reason why we are motivated to open this shop. People have been 
        very supportive and we are very grateful for our customers around the town. Next time if you come to our shop, please 
        be sure to chit chat with us as we really love to interact with our customers. Think of our shop as a home for you 
        guys. Thank you for being a supportive customer, we will continue to do our hard work.

        <h1>Our Journey</h1><br>
        <article>
        <p>We have been planning to open the shop at the end of 2019, but then the COVID-19 strike and it just seems it wasn’t 
            a good idea to open the shop. We try to find a reason why there’s still a chance that we can open. We spread some 
            flyers and share them on social media to see if anyone maybe is interested in these cookies and others. Not long after, 
            people tried to reach out to us and told us that they would love to try those cookies. Due to the risky pandemic, we 
            decided to continue with our plan and opened it online in 2020. The story doesn’t stop there. We realized that there 
            are many children who lost both of their parents due to this COVID breakout. This inspired us to do more in this pandemic. 
            We decided to donate our profit to the orphanage. We also give our leftover cookies to homeless people on the street. 
            Even if cookies can’t make them full, we're doing our best to support each other in the worst time as we believe that 
            spreading kindness is our top priority.
